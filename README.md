## Problem Statement  
Lio, a leading telecom provider in India, is planning a **strategic merger** with Jotstar, a top-tier streaming platform. The goal is to **leverage LioCinemaâ€™s subscriber base and Jotstarâ€™s content library** to create Indiaâ€™s leading OTT platform.  

To support this, the management needs detailed insights on:  
âœ… **Content Library Analysis** â€“ Comparing content types across platforms  
âœ… **Subscriber Insights** â€“ Trends in acquisition & demographic distribution  
âœ… **Inactivity Patterns** â€“ Subscriber inactivity across age groups, cities & plans  
âœ… **Upgrade & Downgrade Trends** â€“ Subscription shifts and influencing factors  
âœ… **Content Consumption** â€“ Watch time, device preferences, and engagement  

## Task List  
As a **Data Analyst**, I worked on:  
- **Data Modeling** to optimize performance in Power BI  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** for actionable insights  
- **Interactive Dashboards** to visualize trends & business impact  
- **Insights & Recommendations** for post-merger strategies  

## Insights and Recommendations from the Dashboard  
- **Jotstar dominates in Drama, Thriller, Fantasy, and Adventure, while Liocinema has a stronger presence in Family, Horror, and Crime. A merger can create a diverse content portfolio, catering to a wider audience base and enhancing customer retention.**
- **VIP and Premium plans have the highest retention rates (86%+), indicating strong loyalty among high-paying users. A combined platform can focus on expanding high-retention plans, bundling exclusive content, and improving cross-platform engagement to maximize revenue.**
- **18-24 age group has the highest premium user base, showing that younger audiences are willing to pay for quality content. The merger should prioritize youth-oriented content, gaming tie-ins, and student-centric pricing strategies to enhance customer acquisition.**
- **47K users (more than half of inactive users) churn within the first month. 31K additional users drop between 1-3 months, meaning 88% of inactivity occurs in the first 3 months.**
- **The majority of inactive users are on Free plans, especially from Tier 3 cities. Paid users, especially in Premium & VIP plans, show much lower inactivity rates.**
- **Shorter subscription durations (0-1 months, 1-3 months) have the highest inactivity, suggesting that long-term subscribers are more likely to remain active.**
- **15% of users have upgraded their subscriptions in the last six months, with the highest upgrade rate observed among the 25-34 age group.**
- **Tier 1 cities show a lower inactivity rate compared to Tier 2 and Tier 3, indicating higher retention in urban areas.**
